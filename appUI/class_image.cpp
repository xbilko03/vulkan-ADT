/*
* Name		    : class_image.cpp
* Project	    : A Debugging Tool for Vulkan API (VkDebugger)
* Description   : Source file for data class that handles the VkImage state and its data
* 
* Note			: This file might get useful in the future, but is most funcionality is shared between VkImage and VkBuffer
*				  so there is no point in having the same code in multiple files, it's more convenient to just inherit the funcionality
*
* Author        : Jozef Bilko (xbilko03), supervised by Ing. Ján Pečiva Ph.D.
